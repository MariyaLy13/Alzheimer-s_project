# Alzheimer's Disease Exploratory Data Analysis
## Overview
This project explores symptoms that are prevalent in patients with Alzheimer's disease. The analysis uses Python for data cleaning, pre-processing, data transformation, statistical calculations and building visualisations to understand dependencies, while Tableau is used to create interactive visualisations.
## Technologies Used
1. Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn).
2. Jupyter Notebook.
3. Tableau.
4. GitHub.
## Project Workflow
1. Data extraction, preparation, cleaning, transformation and exploratory analysis with visualization (Python).
2. Creating interactive dashboards and visual reports (Tableau).

## Insights and Conclusions:
- The analysed dataset contains information on 760 patients with Alzheimer's disease (35.4%) and 1389 patients without Alzheimer's disease (64.6%).
- 50.8% of patients with Alzheimer's disease are male and 49.2% are female.
- The largest group of patients have Caucasian ethnicity - 1278 people (32.2% diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease), but Asians have the highest percentage of diagnosed Alzheimer's disease - 40.8%.
- The highest percentage of people diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease have a high school education.
- The analysis doesn't show any difference between most of the individual lifestyle factors in the group of patients with and without Alzheimer's disease, except for sleep quality. The percentage of patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease who sleep 4-5 hours is 5.5% higher than in patients without a diagnosis (35.5% to 30%).
- There wasn't a direct correlation between medical history and Alzheimer's diagnosis.
- Patients without Alzheimer's disease had lower HDL cholesterol levels.
- Patients with Alzheimer's disease were 3 times more likely to have memory complaints and behavioural problems.
- There are 10% more memory problems than behavioural problems in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Memory problems do not always lead to behavioural problems.
- Asians have fewer behavioural problems (21.4%) than other ethnic groups, even when memory problems are highest (42.9%). Caucasians have a percentage of behavioural problems close to that of African Americans (27.6% to 28.1%) when the percentage of memory problems is about 5% lower (35.2% to 40.4%). These differences could be explored further to understand what helps some patients avoid behavioural problems when memory problems occur.
- The most common symptom experienced by people with Alzheimer's disease is forgetfulness (30.1%). Confusion (19.5%), difficulty doing tasks (16.3%), disorientation and personality changes (14.6% and 14.1% rese- - Forgetfulness is the most common symptom across all ethnic groups, but varies widely:
  - African Americans - 34.9%.
  - Caucasians - 30.9%.
  - Asians - 25.0%.
  - Other - 20.9%.
- African Americans report higher rates of confusion (21.9%) than others. Asians have the highest rate of difficulty in completing tasks (23.8%)
